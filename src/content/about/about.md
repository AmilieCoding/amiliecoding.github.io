A small blog for me (Amilie) to share my thoughts, express my opinions and do research on things in the Linux space.

I don't know how often I'll update this thing, but it'll be relatively frequently. It shouldn't be too hard to read or find posts on - if you have any topics you'd like me to cover, contact me in Archcord :)
