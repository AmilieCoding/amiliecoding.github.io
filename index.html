Hey! I'm Amilie and welcome to my blog! I'm just gonna write a few stuff about
my experience running Arch, Linux, owning Archcord and eventually doing
my own servers! Here I'll conduct research, opinionated posts, or whatever
the fact.

Follow along with me at https://archcord.org/discord if you are interested :)
