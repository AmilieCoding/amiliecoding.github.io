  <h1>Amilie's Website</h1><br>
  <h2>What is this website about? Well, it's a place for me to put all my cool projects on!</h2>
  <h2>Who am I though? I'm genderfluid and go by any pronouns! You'll most likely find me in discord.gg/linux, you can reach out to me there!</h2>
  <h2>My pronouns are she/he/they for those who got a bit confused with my last sentence :)</h2>


  <h1>My Desktop</h1><br>
  <div class="containerImg">
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3>I love ricing my desktop and making it look fancy! While the style I enjoy might not be to everyones tune I really enjoy it as it allows me to be productive and have a pretty computer :D, I learnt CSS just for making Wofi and Waybar and decided it'd be fun to make a website! That's why amilie.gay exists lol</h3>
      <h4>I did try to make the text to the right, but I couldn't do that, but I'll figure it out at some point! I know the website is a tiny bit clunky right now xD, but who cares as long as it works really?</h4>
