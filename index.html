    <h1>Amilie.Gay</h1>
    <h2>Amilie.gay is created by Amilie to host all of her projects on as a general portfolio, if you'd like more information about this site you can either scroll down to see my projects, or email me at amilie@allthingslinux.com, this website is simply a hobby project and won't look extremely fancy as much as I try to make it look fancy! If you'd like to help me make it fancier, be sure to email me! I'd love some help!</h2>

    <h3>My Dotfiles</h3>

    <h5>These are my dotfiles, and they can be installed on all distros which support Hyprland! However, I do have to use the Nouveau drivers because NVIDIA drivers on Fedora are pretty awful so I am capped in what I can do games wise. So if you are going to use them, I heavily recommend using them on Arch or some other distro which has proper support for the NVIDIA drivers. I also recommend installing all the accompanied software like Mako, Waybar, Kitty and Wofi for the proper experience.<br>If you would like to download these dotfiles you can find them at https://github.com/AmilieCoding/dotfiles or if you want to make your own theme based off the colour scheme only you can check the colour theme out at https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin, the specific theme is called Mocha!</h5>
